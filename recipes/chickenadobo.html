    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A simple easy to make Filipino chicken dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>20 garlic cloves, heavily crushed</li>
            <li>Crack of black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (300ml) unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (7g) black peppercorns</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons palm sugar (50g)</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
            <li>Green onions for topping</li>
            <li>Rice for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add in all the chicken (thighs and drumsticks) and heavily crushed cloves of garlic.</li>
            <li>To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, black peppercorns, palm sugar, unseasoned rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, filtered water, and toss together and add in bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or ideally overnight. **Reserve all marinated liquid**</li>
            <li>Set a large braiser or dutch over over medium-high heat and coat with oil to cover the pan.</li>
            <li>Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side. Place each batch to the side once done browning to avoid overcrowding.</li>
            <li>Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along with all the aromatics. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces to the pan in layers and bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer (covered) for 35 minutes. Uncover and flip the chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook for another 25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to throughly coat and the sauce thickens and glaze.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken on a plate of rice topped with green onions. Spoon on as much sauce as desired.</li>
        </ol>
